#HTML Elements
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
These tags make your HTML easier to read, and also help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
