Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this <h1>
Closing tags look like this: </h1>

#1. Headline and Paragraph 
<h1> CatPhotoApp </h1>
<p> Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff </p>

#2. HTML Elements
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
These tags make your HTML easier to read, and also help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

#3. Adding Images
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="Cat lying down">

p.s: img elements are self-closing, alt element is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

#4. Link to External/Internal Pages with Anchor Elements
* Anchor elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. 
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> (external)

* Anchor elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.
To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
anchor tag: <a href="#footer">Jump to Bottom</a> (internal)
refer to: <footer id="footer">Copyright Cat Photo App</footer>

p.s: target="_blank" is used to the anchor linked document to open in a new window tab.

#5. Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
<p> View more <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a> </p>

#6. Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol
<p>Click here to view more <a href="#" target="_blank">cat photos</a>.</p>

#7. Turn image into link
Simply nest the image within 'a' element:
 <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
 
#8. Create a Bulleted List
* Unordered lists start with an opening <ul> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a </ul>
<ul>
   <li>grass</li>
   <li>catnip</li>
   <li>fish</li>
 </ul>

*Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, ordered lists close with a </ol>
<ol>
    <li>cold</li>
    <li>distracted</li>
    <li>scary things</li>
  </ol>
  
 #9. Create a Text and Placeholder Field
 Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.
 <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
 
 #10. Create a Form Element plus button to submit it
 You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.
 <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
    <button type="submit">submit</button>
    </form>
 #11. Use HTML5 to Require a Field
 You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
 Simply add 'required' behind the input code
 <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
 
 #12. Create a Set of Radio Buttons
 You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
 Radio buttons are a type of input. Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element.
 All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
 
  <label for="indoor">
     <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor</label>
  <label for="outdoor">
     <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor</label>
  
  #13 Create a Set of Checkboxes
  Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.
  Checkboxes are type of input.
  All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.
  
    <label for="cute"><input id="cute" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
    <label for="playful"><input id="playful" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
    <label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
    
  #14. Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element
  The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.
  Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line with </div>.
 
  #15. Define Head and Body element
  You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.
  Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.
