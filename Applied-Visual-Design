Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.
At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.

#1. Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.
<style>
  h4 {text-align: center; } <\style>

#2. Adjust the Width / Height of an Element
You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. 
img {width: 220px;}
img {height: 245px;}

#3. Use the <strong> Tag to Make Text Bold, <u> tag to make Underline, <em> to Make Italic Text, <s> to Strikethrough Text
To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.
 <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</p> <!-- Stanford Univ become bold -->
 <u>Ph.D. students</u>
 
#4. Create a Horizontal Line Using the <hr> Element
In HTML, hr is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.

#5. Adjust the background-color Property of Text
Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize.
rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity
<style>  
background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1); </style>

#6. Adjust the Size of a Header Versus a Paragraph Tag
The font size of header tags (h1 through h6) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the font-size property to adjust the size of the text in an element.
<style>
text-size: 20px; </style>

#7. Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element
The box-shadow property takes values for offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element), offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element), blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value, in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

#thumbnail {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
  }

#8. Decrease the Opacity of an Element
The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.
A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all; A value of 0.5 is half see-through; A value of 0 is completely transparent.
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
    opacity: 0.7;
 
#9. Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase
The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

text-transform: uppercase;

#10. Set the font-weight/size for Heading Elements
The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.
<p>
font-size: 16px;
font-weight: 200;
</p>

#11. Set the line-height of Paragraphs
CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.
<p>
line-height: 25px; </p>

#12. Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag
A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.
For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover { color: blue;}

#13. Change an Element's Relative Position
